# never-quorum

> We never reach consensus, but we keep trying.

A collective of developers building tools, services, and writing about distributed systems, object storage, and the beautiful chaos of eventual consistency.

## What We Do

We create minimal, focused projects that solve real problems in distributed computing. Our work spans:

- **Mini Services**: Lightweight utilities for S3-compatible object storage and beyond
- **Technical Writing**: In-depth blog posts about distributed systems, storage architectures, and lessons learned
- **Open Tools**: Practical implementations of distributed systems concepts

## Philosophy

Systems fail. Networks partition. Clocks drift. We embrace these realities rather than pretend they don't exist.

Our projects are:
- **Minimal**: No unnecessary complexity
- **Pragmatic**: Built for real-world use cases
- **Educational**: Code that teaches while it works

## Projects

Coming soon. We're still syncing our vector clocks.

## Writing

Our blog posts explore the intersection of theory and practice in distributed systems. Expect deep dives, war stories, and the occasional admission that we were wrong.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions, though we make no promises about reaching consensus on pull requests. Open an issue, start a discussion, or submit a PR.

## History

This isn't our first attempt. **marmotitude** came before us and taught us valuable lessons about maintenance, scope, and the importance of actually finishing things.

We're trying again. Differently this time.

## Contact

Find us where distributed systems people gather. You know where.
